  cross-env NODE_ENV=testing

#### Notes

- Run `index.js` with Nodemon executing `npm run dev`.
- Run tests locally with Jest executing `npm test`.
- You can add console.logs to `index.js` to manually test your code. (e.g. `console.log(car.drive(10));`).
- The output of your log statements can be found in the terminal you run `npm run dev` in.

#### Hot Tips

- You will need to brush up on your JavaScript and use the Jest documentation to solve this challenge.
- Do not install Jest, as it's already installed.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries or add extra scripts. Do not update existing dependencies.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work.
- Perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
